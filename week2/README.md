<h3> Structure of Person </h3>
<h5> Instruction: </h5>

"Create a c file that contains the logic and structure for a person.
This should include at the very least functions to marry, divorce, birth (create a child and link them up).
You should be able to check who someone's spouse is and what children they have.
I encourage you to play around and explore with additional methods you think might be interesting.

Once you have the ability to create some people, create a linked list of them.
This should be another structure of your own creation that can store people.
Make some supplemental functions that can print all the names of the people in your list,
and print their spouses.
Consider how you would duplicate the list if necessary.

If you have extra time, try to create a method that reverses the current list.
Original list order should be the order that items were added."
