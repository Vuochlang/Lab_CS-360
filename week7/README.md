<h2> Substitute Function </h2>

2/26/2021

<p>Week 7: 
The "sub" program will take input from the user via stdin, and for every pair of
command line arguments, it will replace every instance of the first character
in the input with the second, writing the result to stdout.</p>

<p>For example, "./sub e z l t"
If the user passes the string "hello world" to stdin, then the result, "hztto wortd", is written to stdout</p>
